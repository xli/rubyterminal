!start Terminal with '.terminal.running' file created
!remove '.terminal.running' when Terminal shutdown
!fork and run command
!output output of forked process into '.terminal.output'

!detect Terminal running in directory or parent directory
!write Terminal command file(full path) and read the output to output
!shutdown process when the '.terminal.input' file is gone
